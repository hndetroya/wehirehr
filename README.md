URL: http://testx1.info/wehirefrontend/

Welcome to my GitHub repository on the WeHire Headless WordPress website. This website was built using WordPress as a Backend and leveraging the REST API to create a headless HTML5 website that runs on Bootstrap 4 and makes HTTP requests via AJAX and jQuery. 2 custom plugins were coded in PHP to create the post types and the base logic as well as all the corresponding fields for such post types.
Please follow these steps in order for you to be able to log into the headless site and create and edit interviewers, candidates and interviews:
1. Go to: http://testx1.info/wehirefrontend/
2. Click on "Get Started".
3. Log in with the admin access.
4. Navigate to one of the internal listings either it be for interviewers, candidates or interviews.
5. Click on "Add new interviewer/candidate/interview".
6. Log into the WordPress admin interface and make changes to the posts you have created via the Frontend.
7. Enjoy.
